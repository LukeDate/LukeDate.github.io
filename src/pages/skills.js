            <Text><a href="/transcript/Transcript_Final_Luke_Date.pdf" target='_blank'>Transcript of grades</a></Text>
            <Text>Over the four year course I developed many technical skills covering a wide range of disciplines - Mathematical methods, advanced Physics, laboratory techniques, data handling, data modelling using Python and using practical astronomy equipment and software. I have a passion for astronomy and cosmology and enjoy learning about the inner workings of the Universe. In my final year Master's project I gained experience in measuring the age of the Universe through historical techniques of famous Physicists whilst using the latest astronomy equipment to gather data. </Text>
